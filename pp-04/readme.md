# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://material.io/guidelines/usability/accessibility.html#accessibility-implementation
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
"Label visual UI elements"
By placing the label inside the input box I am saving space on the screen and making it clutter free.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
"Adhere to the safe area and layout margins defined by UIKit."
Not all phones is like the iphone x and samsung S8 and S9, where they have all screen on one side of the device so there needs a safe area to put text and such in.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742462.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
"Thus, the ultimate measure of power is productivity, not the number of features."
Prefer simple and effective than fancy but messy.
